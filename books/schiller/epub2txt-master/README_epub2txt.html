<h1>epub2txt -- Extract text from EPUB documents</h1> 

Version 0.1.4, March 2016

<h2>What is this?</h2>

<code>epub2html</code> is a simple command-line utility for 
extracting text from
EPUB documents and, optionally, re-flowing it to fit a text display
of a particular number of columns. It is written entirely in ANSI-standard
C, and should run on any Unix-like system with a C compiler. It is
intended for reading EPUB e-books on embedded systems that can't host a 
graphical EPUB viewer, or converting such e-books to read on those systems.
However, it should be robust enough for other purposes, such as batch 
indexing of EPUB document collections.
</p>
<code>epub2html</code> favours speed and low memory usage over
accuracy of rendering. Most of the formatting of the source document
will be lost but, with a text-only display, this is likely to be of
little consequence.
</p>
This utility is specifically written to have no dependencies on external
libraries, except the standard C library, and even on this is makes
few demands. It does expect to be able to run an "unzip" command,
however. The purpose of minimizing dependencies is to allow the 
utility to build on embedded systems without needing to build a bunch
of dependencies.
</p>
<code>epub2txt</code> will output UTF8-encoded text by default, but can
be told to output ASCII, in which case it will try to convert non-ASCII
characters into something displayable if possible.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<code>epub2html</code> is intended to run on Linux and other Unix-like
systems. It makes use of the common Unix <code>unzip</code> utility
but has no other dependencies. 
It builds and runs on Windows under Cygwin,
but not as a native Windows console application.
The system must be set up such that there is a temporary
directory at <code>/tmp</code> that users can write to, unless the
environment variable <code>TMP</code> is set, in which case the utility
will use that instead. 

<h2>Building and installing</h2>

<code>epub2txt</code> builds and installs from a simple Makefile.
On most systems, all you should need to do is

<pre class="codeblock">
$ make
# make install
</pre>


<h2>Bugs and limitations</h2>

There is no support for any form of DRM or encryption, and such support
is unlikely to be added in the future.
<p/>

<code>epub2txt</code> only handles documents that use 
UTF8 (or ASCII) encoding (but I believe that UTF8 is more-or-less 
universal in EPUB), 
and writes output only in UTF8 encoding,
regardless of the platform's locale. This limitation exists because
<code>epub2txt</code> does all its own multibyte to fixed-size 
character encoding conversions
to avoid creating a dependency on an external library. Doing this for UTF8
is enough work on its own; doing it for arbitrary encodings would be 
overwhelming. 
<p/>
The program can't correct errors in encoding, and there are a large number
of EPUB documents in public repositories that contain encoding errors.
A common problem is spurious use of non-UTF8 8-bit characters, often 
in documents that have been converted from Microsoft Office applications.
<p/>

<code>epub2txt</code> does not right-justify text, as there are already many
good utilities to do this. A simple approach is to pipe the output 
into <code>nroff</code>, without specifying a width (<code>-w</code>).
Not specifying a width turns off line-breaking in <code>epub2txt</code>,
allowing <code>nroff</code> to justify the paragraphs. 
It will probably
also be necessary to use the <code>--ascii</code> option, 
as <code>nroff</code> does not 
handle UTF8 text very well. For example:

<pre class="codeblock">
epub2txt -a mydoc.epub | nroff
</pre>
<p/>

<code>epub2txt</code> extracts text aggressively, and will include things that
cannot possibly be rendered properly in plain text. This includes constructs
like indices and tables of contents, which will be of little use. The captions
of pictures will also likely be included, even though the pictures themselves
can not. It seemed
better to err on the side of extracting too much text than too little;
unfortunately there is little in the EPUB format to distinguish content that
is meaningful in a text-only representation from that which is not. 
<p/>

It is unlikely that any kind of fixed-layout structure of the 
source document will be rendered accurately in plain text, so
<code>epub2txt</code> does not try. Tabs and other layout elements are 
collapsed
into spaces, and text re-flowed according to the set line length, if any.

<p/>
Conversion of Unicode to ASCII is, in the general case, impossible. The
<code>--ascii</code> switch tells <code>epub2txt</code> to perform some
common conversions, such as straight quotes for angled quotes.
It will also attempt to replace accented latin characters with non-accented
equivalents, at least for commonly-used characters. However, there are
a huge number of characters in the Unicode set that cannot be rendered,
even approximately, in ASCII.
